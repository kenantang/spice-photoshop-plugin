# SPICE Photoshop Plugin

This repository contains the official implementation of **SPICE: A Synergistic, Precise, Iterative, and Customizable Image Editing Workflow**.  
For the paper and reference implementation, see:  
https://github.com/kenantang/spice

The **Photoshop plugin** is the recommended way to use SPICE. It tightly integrates SPICE’s iterative, error-correcting workflow with Photoshop’s powerful editing tools, enabling a seamless and efficient image editing experience.

The first version of the plugin has been **submitted to Adobe** and is currently **under review**. Upon approval, the plugin will be downloadable from the Adobe Marketplace. However, you can already use the code in this repository, if you have the Adobe UXP Developer Tools on your device.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and use the SPICE Photoshop plugin.

### 1. Backend Setup

SPICE requires a backend that supports image inpainting.

- **Supported:** Automatic1111 Web UI  
- **Coming soon:** ComfyUI

Start Automatic1111 with API support enabled:

```bash
./webui.sh --api
```

By default, the Photoshop plugin sends requests to:

```
https://127.0.0.1:7860/
```

and receives edited images from the backend.

### 2. Editing Workflow in Photoshop

Inside Photoshop:

1. Add a **color patch** to the current layer.  
   - The color patch may also be placed on a separate layer.  
   - SPICE always uses the *current visible pixels* as input.
2. Use any **selection tool** to draw:
   - Masks  
   - Context dots
3. Enter a **text prompt**, then click **Generate**.

The edited result will appear as a **new layer** in the document. If you accept the result, you can merge it to the existing layer below. SPICE delivers a smooth and robust editing experience, despite operating as a fully single-layer workflow.

### 3. Controlling Output Quality

SPICE is designed to be controlled with a minimal number of parameters. Two sliders are provided:

- **Denoising Strength**
- **ControlNet Stop Step**

These two parameters are sufficient to achieve high-quality and controllable results, highlighting one of SPICE’s core advantages: powerful editing with very few knobs.


## Version Notes

- **0.0.3**
  - Supports changing parameters in a separate "SPICE Settings" panel. These parameters do not need to be changed frequently, so no sliders are used for them.
  - Adds a reminder message when the backend is not active. The backend can be configured in the settings panel.
  - Uses new icons.

- **0.0.2**
  - Partially fixes full-image selection bug. Now API is not called when the full image is selected.
  - Partially fixes sub-pixel image shift. Now the coordinates are correct, but Photoshop snaps the pasted image to an unwanted grid. The alignment is correct when the zoom level is at the same level when the mask was drawn. Practically, the image shift will not be a problem, as the mask is always drawn at a zoomed-in level.
  - Partially fixes GUI flashing. Now after flashing, the view is still maintained as the same before flashing. This is at least less annoying.
  - Implements error message for no active selection.
  - Supports prompt undo and redo.
  - Supports showing the generation time of the previous run on the button. The progress API interferes with generation and is thus unusable, so no progress bar will be implemented.

- **0.0.1**
  - Initial minimal working version
  - Uses Automatic1111 Web UI as the backend

## Known Issues

1. **Full-image selection bug** 

   Selecting the entire image causes an error, likely due to an edge case in selection inversion.

   *Planned improvement:* Try fix the inversion error.

2. **Sub-pixel image shift (GUI artifact)**  

   The output image appears to shift at the sub-pixel level, when the viewport is zoomed out for a large (4K) image. However, this is purely a Photoshop GUI visual artifact. When the generated result is merged with the existing layer, the shift does not exist. 

   *Planned improvement:* Change pasting method to prevent Photoshop from creating this visual artifact.

3. **GUI flashing**  

   Masks and images are cropped in the GUI before being sent to the backend, which can cause flashing.

   *Planned improvement:* these basic image operations should be handled completely by the JS code, but not Photoshop GUI operations

4. **PPI inconsistency issues**  
   The current image-pasting logic is not robust to different PPI settings.  
   
   **Workaround:**  
   - Start from an image with a consistent PPI (e.g., one generated by Automatic1111 text-to-image)
   - Resize the canvas while preserving PPI

    *Planned improvement:* since the GUI operations are sensitive to PPI, try to find a way to avoid GUI operations, similar to the solution of GUI flashing
